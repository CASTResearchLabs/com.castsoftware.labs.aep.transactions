AEP Transaction Management Preview (discontinued now)

This extension is a CAST Research Labs extension.
Its purpose is data collection to help support a specification design in progress - or a specification promotion - with data points from real application.
Due to its research nature, this extension can be evolved in a drastically different direction at "any" time (e.g.: following a decision of a CISQ workshop, or in response to a review from the OMG Architecture Driven Modernization Task Force). It also means it will be discontinued once the research is over.
